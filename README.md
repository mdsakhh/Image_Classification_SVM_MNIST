Support vector machines (SVMs)
Image data classification
Machine learning model
1. First, we need to import the necessary libraries, such as numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib.
2. Next, we need to load the image dataset that you want to classify. This could be done by reading the images from a directory or by loading them from a file. We also need to split the data into training and test sets, using a function like train_test_split from scikit-learn.
3. Once we have the dataset, we need to extract features from the images. This could be done using techniques like edge detection, texture analysis, or color histograms. The extracted features will be used as input to the SVM model.
4. After extracting the features, we need to create an SVM model using the SVC class from scikit-learn. we can specify the type of kernel to use (e.g., linear, polynomial, or radial basis function) and any other hyperparameters that we want to set.
5. Next, we can train the model on the training data using the fit method.
6. Finally, we can evaluate the model's performance on the test set using the score method. This will give us an idea of how well the model is able to classify the images in the test set.!!!

DataSet: MNIST
MNIST: This is a dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used for testing machine learning algorithms. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
